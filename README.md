# Monte Carlo Stock Simulation Tool

This repository contains scripts to generate, simulate, and filter stock data based on historical analysis using Monte Carlo methods. The data simulation is modeled on real historical stock data and generates synthetic stock data that adheres to the statistical patterns found in the historical dataset.

## Overview
This tool fetches historical stock data, performs statistical analysis, and generates synthetic data using Monte Carlo simulations. The generated data is then filtered to ensure that it meets predefined statistical constraints. This project is intended for educational purposes and should not be used for commercial purposes without permission.

## Scripts

### `pull_data.py`
This script is responsible for fetching historical stock data from Yahoo Finance. It performs the following functions:
- Fetches 60 days of historical stock data for selected stocks at 30-minute intervals.
- Analyzes the historical data to calculate key statistics, such as percentiles, mean, and standard deviation.
- Saves the analysis results to a JSON file, which is used as input for the simulation script.

### `sim_data.py`
This script uses the analysis generated by `pull_data.py` to simulate new stock data based on historical trends. It performs the following functions:
- Generates synthetic stock data for a given number of days and intervals using Monte Carlo simulation.
- Ensures the simulated data adheres to the statistical patterns found in the historical data.
- Saves the generated simulations to CSV files.

### `select_sim_data.py`
This script validates the simulated data to ensure it meets the predefined statistical constraints. It performs the following functions:
- Loads the simulated data and checks if it adheres to the percentiles and trends from the historical analysis.
- Removes any simulated data that falls outside the acceptable range.
- Renumbers the remaining simulations and saves them to a new `simulated` folder.

## How the Data was Created
1. **Historical Data Fetching**: The `pull_data.py` script fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance for a specified time period (60 days) and interval (30 minutes). The script analyzes this data to extract important statistical parameters such as percentiles and standard deviations.

2. **Data Simulation**: The `sim_data.py` script uses the statistical analysis from the historical data to generate synthetic stock data. It simulates stock prices and volumes over a set number of days, ensuring the synthetic data matches the historical patterns.

3. **Data Validation**: The `select_sim_data.py` script verifies that the simulated data adheres to the constraints derived from historical data. It removes any outliers or invalid simulations and renumbers the valid simulations for consistency.
